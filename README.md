## VSCode keybindings for Mac and PC
Some of my own and default configuration for making keyboard shortcuts easy to navigate around vscode. Since I use both Mac and PC, I like to keep my keyboard shortcuts consistent except switching between ctrl and cmd. Multiple times I have had a situation to setup my keybindings. I had to find and remember my previous keyboard shortcuts. So, I keep this JSON file here to easily import when I need it :smile:

**List of keybindings**
| Key      | Commands |
| :---        |    :---   |
| cmd+b(Mac) OR ctrl+b(PC)      | Toggle sidebar visibility       |
| cmd+'(Mac) OR ctrl+'(PC)      | Toggle terminal       |
| cmd+,(Mac) OR ctrl+,(PC)      | Focus terminal       |
| cmd+1(Mac) OR ctrl+1(PC)      | Focus first editor group       |
| shift+cmd+;(Mac) OR shift+ctrl+;(PC)      | Terminal split      |
| cmd+k(Mac) OR ctrl+k(PC)      | Terminal kill      |
| cmd+l(Mac) OR ctrl+l(PC)      | Switch terminal       |
| shift+cmd+n(Mac) OR shift+ctrl+n(PC)      | New window      |
